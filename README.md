Hello!

ta-clctech stands for test-assignment-clc-tech (see it below). It is a very simple (CRUD) application written in PHP. The goal is just to get hands dirty! :-)

1. \* Create a minimal application using yii2 framework and put it in a new repo.
2. \* Create a new branch and then create a model called 'message' containing fields 'id' and 'text'.
3. Create a migration for the data (you may use any DB you like).
4. Create a controller for the model with two actions: 'create' and 'view'.
5. Install a component that communicates with telegram (longman/telegram-bot for example).
6. Every time a user creates the message you send it to a person in telegram.
7. \* Publish your project on GitHub or Bitbucket.

P.S. Steps marked with '*' are mandatory. You will get 1 point for every other step.

You should complete the task within a week. If you will complete it in less than a week you will get an extra point.

Good luck!
